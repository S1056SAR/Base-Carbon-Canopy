### Knowledge Base and Implementation Guide

#### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the team has:
- **Software Setup**:
  - Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm/yarn for frontend and blockchain development.
  - Python (version 3.8 or higher) and pip for AutoML scripting.
  - Git for version control.
  - A code editor compatible with AI tools (e.g., VS Code or Cursor).
  - MetaMask browser extension for wallet interactions.
- **Accounts**:
  - A MetaMask wallet funded with Base Sepolia testnet ETH via a faucet (e.g., Alchemy’s Base Sepolia faucet).
  - A Vercel account for hosting the DApp.
  - A Google Colab account for AutoML model training (free tier sufficient).
- **Team Skills**:
  - **Blockchain Developer**: Familiarity with writing and deploying smart contracts using Solidity, understanding ERC-1155 token standards, and using Hardhat for testing and deployment.
  - **Frontend Developer**: Experience with React for building single-page applications, JavaScript for dynamic interactions, and CSS for styling. Basic knowledge of blockchain wallet integration (e.g., ethers.js).
  - **Data Scientist**: Proficiency in Python for data manipulation, basic machine learning concepts, and experience with libraries like pandas. No advanced ML expertise required, as Auto-Keras simplifies model training.
- **External Resources**:
  - Access to a public voluntary carbon market (VCM) dataset, such as the Verra registry, for AutoML training (CSV format with project prices, types, and dates).
  - Documentation for Base Sepolia (e.g., Base.org), OpenZeppelin, Auto-Keras, Leaflet.js, and Vercel.

#### Week 1: Blockchain Implementation
**Goal**: Develop and deploy smart contracts on Base Sepolia testnet to handle carbon credit tokenization, trading, and retirement, using mock USDC for payments.

1. **Set Up Blockchain Environment**:
   - Initialize a Hardhat project to manage smart contract development, testing, and deployment.
   - Install dependencies for Hardhat, OpenZeppelin (for ERC-1155 templates), and a tool to manage environment variables (e.g., dotenv).
   - Configure Hardhat to connect to the Base Sepolia testnet using the network’s public RPC URL (available from Base.org) and a private key from a MetaMask wallet.
   - Secure the private key in an environment file, ensuring it’s excluded from version control.
   - Obtain testnet ETH for the wallet via a Base Sepolia faucet to cover deployment and transaction costs.

2. **Design Carbon Credit Contract**:
   - Create a smart contract for carbon credits using the ERC-1155 standard, which supports multiple token types (each representing a unique carbon offset project).
   - Include functionality to:
     - **Mint** tokens for new projects, restricted to the contract owner (representing a verifier or admin for the hackathon demo).
     - **Trade** tokens between users, requiring payment in mock USDC with a 1% fee transferred to the contract owner.
     - **Retire** tokens to mark credits as used (burning them or locking them in the contract).
   - Store metadata for each project (e.g., project name, location, total carbon tons) in a mapping, accessible publicly for transparency.
   - Emit events for minting, trading, and retiring to log transaction details on-chain (e.g., project ID, amount, addresses, price).
   - Use a placeholder URI for token metadata (e.g., a mock API endpoint), as off-chain metadata storage (e.g., IPFS) is out of scope for the hackathon.

3. **Design Mock USDC Contract**:
   - Create a simple ERC-20 contract to simulate USDC on the testnet, as real USDC isn’t available on Sepolia.
   - Include functions to:
     - Mint tokens to test accounts (for demo purposes, controlled by the contract owner).
     - Transfer tokens between addresses (used during trading).
     - Approve the carbon credit contract to spend tokens on behalf of users.
   - Ensure the contract has a fixed decimal precision (e.g., 6 decimals, mimicking USDC).

4. **Test and Deploy Contracts**:
   - Write unit tests to verify minting, trading, retiring, and fee collection work as expected. Test edge cases (e.g., insufficient USDC balance, unauthorized minting).
   - Use Hardhat’s local blockchain for initial testing to save testnet ETH.
   - Deploy both contracts to Base Sepolia testnet, recording their addresses for DApp integration.
   - Mint 5–10 mock projects (e.g., “Kenya Reforestation,” “India Methane Capture”) with 100–500 tokens each and distribute mock USDC to test accounts.

**Key Concepts**:
- **ERC-1155**: A multi-token standard allowing multiple project types in one contract, reducing gas costs compared to ERC-721.
- **Base Sepolia**: A testnet for Base, an Ethereum layer-2 chain, offering low-cost transactions and EVM compatibility.
- **Events**: On-chain logs for tracking transactions, queryable by the DApp for trade history.
- **Gas Optimization**: Use events instead of storage variables for metadata to minimize costs on testnet.

**Deliverables**: Deployed carbon credit and mock USDC contracts, testnet addresses, 5–10 mock projects minted, test accounts funded with mock USDC.

#### Week 2: AutoML Implementation
**Goal**: Develop a lightweight AutoML pipeline to predict carbon credit prices, generating static forecasts for DApp integration.

1. **Source Data**:
   - Obtain a small, public VCM dataset (e.g., from Verra’s registry or a similar source) in CSV format, containing 100–500 rows with columns like:
     - Date (e.g., “2025-05-01”).
     - Project type (e.g., “reforestation,” “renewable energy”).
     - Carbon tons (e.g., 100).
     - Price per ton (e.g., $10.50).
   - If no dataset is available, create a mock CSV with similar columns, simulating 5–10 projects over 1–2 years (e.g., 100 rows with varying prices).
   - Ensure the dataset is clean (no missing values) or includes a preprocessing step to handle gaps.

2. **Set Up AutoML Environment**:
   - Use Google Colab’s free tier to train the AutoML model, as it provides GPU support and preinstalled libraries.
   - Install Python libraries: pandas (for data manipulation), Auto-Keras (for AutoML), and scikit-learn (for data splitting).
   - Alternatively, use a local Python environment if Colab’s limits (e.g., session timeouts) are restrictive.

3. **Design AutoML Pipeline**:
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it:
     - Convert dates to numeric values (e.g., Unix timestamps) for model compatibility.
     - Encode categorical columns (e.g., project type) using one-hot encoding.
     - Normalize numeric columns (e.g., carbon tons) to a 0–1 range if needed.
   - Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate model performance.
   - Use Auto-Keras to create a regression model that predicts the price per ton based on input features (date, project type, tons).
   - Limit Auto-Keras to 5 trials (model architectures) and 10 epochs per trial to reduce training time (should complete in <1 hour on Colab).
   - Evaluate the model using mean squared error (MSE) on the test set, aiming for reasonable accuracy (e.g., MSE < 10% of average price).
   - Save the trained model weights for reuse in the demo.

4. **Generate Static Forecasts**:
   - Create a small set of sample inputs (e.g., 10 rows representing current projects) to generate price predictions.
   - Run the model on these inputs to predict next-week prices (e.g., “$10.50, likely to rise to $11.00”).
   - Save predictions in a JSON file with fields like project ID, current price, predicted price, and confidence (if available).
   - This JSON file will be statically loaded into the DApp, avoiding real-time model inference during the hackathon.

**Key Concepts**:
- **AutoML**: Automated machine learning simplifies model selection and hyperparameter tuning, ideal for hackathons with limited ML expertise.
- **Auto-Keras**: A user-friendly AutoML library that uses neural architecture search to build regression models, suitable for small datasets.
- **Static Predictions**: Precomputing forecasts avoids deploying a live ML server, reducing complexity for the demo.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Essential for ML, ensuring inputs are numeric and consistent to avoid model errors.

**Deliverables**: Trained AutoML model, mock or real VCM dataset (CSV), static JSON file with 10 price predictions.

#### Week 3: DApp Implementation
**Goal**: Build a React-based DApp to interact with the blockchain contracts and display project locations and AutoML forecasts.

1. **Set Up Frontend Environment**:
   - Initialize a React project using a tool like Create React App to streamline setup.
   - Install dependencies:
     - Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
     - Leaflet.js for interactive maps.
     - ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
     - Chart.js for visualizing price trends.
     - react-router-dom for basic navigation (optional).
   - Configure the project to connect to Base Sepolia via MetaMask, using the testnet’s RPC URL.

2. **Design DApp Interface**:
   - Create a single-page application with three main sections:
     - **Map View**: An interactive map showing 5–10 mock projects.
     - **Trading Interface**: Forms to buy, sell, or retire carbon credits.
     - **Forecast Dashboard**: A display of AutoML price predictions.
   - Use Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, responsive design (e.g., mobile-friendly layout with a sidebar or tabs).
   - Include a “Connect Wallet” button to authenticate users via MetaMask.

3. **Implement Map View**:
   - Use Leaflet.js to render an OpenStreetMap-based map centered on a global view (e.g., coordinates [0, 0], zoom level 2).
   - Plot 5–10 mock projects as markers, each with:
     - Coordinates (e.g., [1.29, 36.82] for Kenya, [28.70, 77.10] for India).
     - Popup text showing project name, type, and available tons.
   - Source mock project data from a static JSON file or hardcode it in the DApp, matching the projects minted in the blockchain contract.
   - Ensure markers are clickable and the map is zoomable for user interaction.

4. **Implement Trading Interface**:
   - Create forms to:
     - **Buy**: Select a project ID, specify the number of tokens, and pay in mock USDC (including 1% fee).
     - **Sell**: List owned tokens for sale, specifying a price in USDC.
     - **Retire**: Burn or lock tokens to mark them as used.
   - Use ethers.js to interact with the carbon credit contract, calling functions for trading and retirement.
   - Display the user’s wallet balance (mock USDC and carbon credits) after connecting MetaMask.
   - Show a trade history table (project ID, amount, price, timestamp) by querying contract events.

5. **Implement Forecast Dashboard**:
   - Load the static JSON file from the AutoML step (containing 10 predictions).
   - Display predictions in two formats:
     - A line chart (using Chart.js) showing price trends for each project over time (e.g., current vs. predicted price).
     - A text summary (e.g., “Kenya Reforestation: Current $10.50, Predicted $11.00 in 7 days”).
   - Style the dashboard to be visually distinct (e.g., a card layout with bold fonts).

6. **Integrate Blockchain and Wallet**:
   - Use ethers.js to connect to Base Sepolia and interact with the carbon credit and USDC contracts.
   - Prompt users to connect MetaMask on page load, retrieving their wallet address.
   - Handle contract calls (e.g., approve USDC spending, execute trades) with error handling for cases like insufficient balance or network issues.
   - Listen for contract events (e.g., CreditTraded, CreditRetired) to update the trade history in real-time.

**Key Concepts**:
- **React**: A component-based framework for building dynamic UIs, ideal for single-page DApps.
- **Leaflet.js**: A lightweight library for interactive maps, compatible with free OpenStreetMap tiles.
- **ethers.js**: Simplifies blockchain interactions, including wallet connections and contract calls.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid, responsive styling with utility classes.
- **Static JSON**: Using precomputed data for forecasts keeps the DApp simple and serverless.

**Deliverables**: Functional React DApp with map, trading forms, and forecast dashboard, connected to testnet contracts.

#### Week 4: Testing and Polish
**Goal**: Test the integrated system, deploy the DApp, and prepare a hackathon presentation.

1. **Test the System**:
   - **Blockchain**: Verify contract functionality using Hardhat tests:
     - Minting restricted to owner.
     - Trading transfers tokens and USDC with correct fees.
     - Retirement removes tokens from circulation.
     - Events emit correct data.
   - **DApp**: Manually test:
     - Wallet connection via MetaMask.
     - Buying, selling, and retiring credits.
     - Map rendering and marker interactions.
     - Forecast display accuracy (matches JSON data).
   - **AutoML**: Check that predictions in the JSON file are reasonable (e.g., within 10–20% of current prices) by comparing to the input dataset.
   - Use a test account to simulate 10–20 trades, ensuring the trade history updates correctly.

2. **Polish the DApp**:
   - Refine the UI with consistent fonts, colors, and spacing (e.g., green tones to reflect sustainability).
   - Add loading indicators for blockchain transactions and error messages for failed actions (e.g., “Insufficient USDC”).
   - Ensure the map is responsive (works on mobile) and the forecast chart is clear (e.g., labeled axes, tooltips).
   - Preload the DApp with mock data (10 projects, 100 trades) to make the demo engaging.

3. **Deploy the DApp**:
   - Host the React DApp on Vercel’s free tier:
     - Connect the project to a Git repository.
     - Build and deploy the static site.
     - Obtain a public URL for demo access.
   - Verify that the DApp connects to Base Sepolia and loads correctly in browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
   - Share the URL with the hackathon judges.

4. **Prepare Hackathon Presentation**:
   - Create a 5–7 minute presentation (e.g., using Google Slides or Figma) covering:
     - **Problem**: Inefficiencies in the voluntary carbon market (lack of transparency, high fees, limited access).
     - **Solution**: Base Carbon Canopy with AutoML for accessible, predictive trading.
     - **Innovation**: Combines Base blockchain, ERC-1155 tokens, and AutoML for a novel VCM platform.
     - **SDG Impact**: Supports SDG 13 (emission reduction), 9 (technological innovation), 10 (equity for small projects).
     - **Demo**: Live walkthrough of connecting a wallet, trading a credit, retiring a credit, viewing the map, and checking forecasts.
     - **Feasibility**: Built in 4 weeks with open-source tools, scalable to mainnet with further development.
   - Include screenshots of the DApp and a 1-minute video clip of the demo for backup.
   - Rehearse the presentation to fit the time limit and address potential judge questions (e.g., “How accurate are the forecasts?”).

**Key Concepts**:
- **End-to-End Testing**: Ensures blockchain, DApp, and AutoML components work together seamlessly.
- **Vercel**: A serverless platform for hosting static React apps, ideal for hackathon demos.

- **Presentation Clarity**: Focus on storytelling (problem-solution-impact) to engage judges.

**Deliverables**: Tested and deployed DApp, public Vercel URL, hackathon presentation, demo-ready prototype with mock data.

### Challenges and Mitigation
1. **Time Constraints**:
   - **Challenge**: Four weeks is tight for blockchain, frontend, and AutoML.
   - **Mitigation**: Use prebuilt tools (OpenZeppelin, Auto-Keras, Create React App) to reduce setup time. Simplify AutoML to basic regression and use static forecasts. Prioritize core features (trading, map, forecasts) over extras (e.g., advanced styling).

2. **Data Availability**:
   - **Challenge**: Limited access to real VCM data for AutoML.
   - **Mitigation**: Create a mock dataset with 100 rows if real data isn’t available. Use Verra’s public registry as a fallback (check verra.org for downloadable reports). Ensure the dataset has enough variability for meaningful predictions.

3. **Team Coordination**:
   - **Challenge**: Integrating blockchain, DApp, and AutoML requires clear communication.
   - **Mitigation**: Assign clear roles (blockchain, frontend, data science) and use a shared Git repository for collaboration. Hold daily standups to sync progress and resolve blockers.

4. **Testnet Issues**:
   - **Challenge**: Base Sepolia faucet delays or network downtime.
   - **Mitigation**: Test contracts locally with Hardhat’s fork mode first. Request testnet ETH early and have backup wallets. Use Alchemy or Infura as alternative RPC providers if needed.

5. **User Experience**:
   - **Challenge**: Non-technical judges may struggle with blockchain concepts.
   - **Mitigation**: Simplify the DApp UI with clear buttons (e.g., “Buy Credit”) and tooltips. Include a demo script in the presentation to guide judges through the flow.

### Integration Details
- **Blockchain to DApp**:
  - The DApp uses ethers.js to call contract functions (mint, trade, retire) and query events for trade history.
  - Contract addresses and ABIs (generated by Hardhat) are hardcoded in the DApp or loaded from a config file.
  - The DApp checks the user’s MetaMask network (Base Sepolia) and prompts switching if incorrect.

- **AutoML to DApp**:
  - The AutoML pipeline outputs a JSON file with predictions, placed in the DApp’s static assets.
  - The DApp reads this file at runtime to populate the forecast dashboard, avoiding server-side logic.
  - The JSON file maps predictions to project IDs, ensuring consistency with blockchain data.

- **Map to Blockchain**:
  - Project locations in the map view correspond to project IDs in the carbon credit contract.
  - The DApp fetches project metadata (name, location) from the contract or a static JSON file for simplicity.

### Hackathon Success Tips
- **Demo Flow**:
  - Start with wallet connection to show accessibility.
  - Buy a credit for a Kenya reforestation project ($10.50, 10 tons).
  - Retire the credit to demonstrate offsetting.
  - Show the map with project markers and popups.
  - Display the forecast dashboard, highlighting a predicted price increase (e.g., “$11.00 in 7 days”).
- **Judge Appeal**:
  - Emphasize the novelty of combining blockchain and AutoML for VCM trading.
  - Highlight SDG 10 (equity) by focusing on small-scale projects in developing regions.
  - Keep technical details concise, focusing on user impact (e.g., “Anyone can offset carbon like shopping online”).
- **Backup Plan**:
  - Record a 1-minute demo video in case of live demo issues (e.g., network failure).
  - Have screenshots and contract addresses ready to show functionality.

### Scalability Beyond Hackathon
While the MVP is hackathon-focused, the design allows future scaling:
- Deploy to Base mainnet for real-world use.
- Integrate real USDC via a bridge or native token.
- Enhance AutoML with real-time data (e.g., API feeds from Verra) and advanced techniques (e.g., triplet loss).
- Add Basenames/Smart Wallets for better accessibility.
- Partner with verifiers (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard) to onboard real projects.
