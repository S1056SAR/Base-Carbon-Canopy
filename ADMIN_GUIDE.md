# Base Carbon Canopy - Admin Panel Guide

## Overview

The Admin Panel is a new administrative interface for the Base Carbon Canopy project that allows the **contract owner** to manage carbon credit projects through a user-friendly web interface, rather than using scripts or direct smart contract interactions.

## Key Features

### üîê **Secure Access Control**
- Only the contract owner can access the admin panel
- Automatic ownership verification through smart contract
- Clear access denied messages for unauthorized users
- Network verification (Base Sepolia only)

### ‚ûï **Add New Projects**
- Intuitive form interface for creating new carbon credit projects
- Real-time form validation with error handling
- Pre-defined project types and locations for consistency
- Automatic coordinate population when selecting locations
- Direct blockchain integration with transaction tracking

### üìä **Project Management**
- View all existing projects with detailed information
- Real-time balance tracking for each project
- Summary statistics dashboard
- Live data fetching from the blockchain
- Integration with BaseScan for transaction verification

## Access the Admin Panel

### Navigation
1. **Desktop**: Look for the "Admin" link in the main navigation (only visible to contract owner)
2. **Mobile**: Find "Admin Panel" in the mobile menu
3. **Direct URL**: Navigate to `/admin`

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ MetaMask wallet connected
- ‚úÖ Connected to Base Sepolia testnet
- ‚úÖ Account must be the contract owner

## Using the Admin Panel

### Adding a New Project

1. **Navigate to Admin Panel** (`/admin`)
2. **Select "Add New Project" Tab**
3. **Fill in Project Details**:
   - **Project Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Kenya Reforestation Initiative")
   - **Project Type**: Choose from predefined types (Reforestation, Renewable Energy, etc.)
   - **Location**: Select from dropdown (auto-fills coordinates)
   - **Latitude/Longitude**: Manual adjustment if needed
   - **Description**: Detailed project description (10-500 characters)
   - **Initial Credit Supply**: Number of carbon credits to mint (1-1,000,000)
   - **Price Per Credit**: Price in mock USDC (0.01-1000)
   - **Recipient Address**: Address to receive minted credits (defaults to your address)

4. **Submit Project**: Click "Create Project" button
5. **Track Transaction**: Monitor progress and view on BaseScan

### Managing Existing Projects

1. **Select "Manage Projects" Tab**
2. **View Summary Statistics**:
   - Total number of projects
   - Total credits minted
   - Your credit balance
   - Average price across projects

3. **Individual Project Information**:
   - Project details and metadata
   - Supply and balance information
   - Price and total value
   - Direct links to contract on BaseScan

4. **Refresh Data**: Use refresh button to update information

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Integration
- **Function Used**: `mintNewProject(name, location, initialSupply, pricePerTon, recipientAddress)`
- **Access Control**: `onlyOwner` modifier ensures security
- **Event Emission**: `ProjectCreated` event for transaction tracking
- **Price Format**: Converts decimal input to 6-decimal USDC format

### Validation & Error Handling
- **Client-side**: Zod schema validation with real-time feedback
- **Blockchain**: Smart contract validation and revert handling
- **Network**: Automatic network switching prompts
- **Addresses**: Ethereum address format validation

### User Experience Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during transactions
- **Success/Error Notifications**: Toast notifications for user feedback
- **Transaction Links**: Direct links to BaseScan for verification
- **Form Reset**: Automatic form clearing after successful submission

## Security Features

### Access Control
```typescript
// Automatic ownership verification
const owner = await carbonCreditContract.owner()
setIsOwner(account.toLowerCase() === owner.toLowerCase())
```

### Network Verification
- Ensures admin actions only occur on Base Sepolia
- Automatic network switching prompts
- Prevents accidental mainnet interactions

### Input Validation
- **Address Validation**: Ethereum address format checking
- **Numeric Validation**: Range checking for supplies and prices
- **String Validation**: Length limits and required fields
- **Coordinate Validation**: Latitude/longitude bounds checking

## Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Access Denied" Error**
   - **Cause**: Connected account is not the contract owner
   - **Solution**: Connect with the deployer/owner account

2. **"Wrong Network" Error**
   - **Cause**: Connected to wrong network
   - **Solution**: Switch to Base Sepolia testnet

3. **"Contract not initialized" Error**
   - **Cause**: Smart contract connection failed
   - **Solution**: Refresh page and reconnect wallet

4. **Transaction Failures**
   - **Cause**: Various (insufficient gas, network issues)
   - **Solution**: Check error message and retry

## Integration with Existing App

### No Disruption to Current Features
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality remains unchanged
- ‚úÖ Main app routes and components untouched
- ‚úÖ Current user experience preserved
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

### Seamless Navigation
- Admin link appears only for contract owner
- Easy navigation between admin and main app
- Consistent UI/UX design language
- Mobile-responsive interface
